# Welcome to Gengo: An AI Powered Japanese Learning Website #

This is my current web dev project. It is not currently delployed but will be soon.
Throughout my Japanese learning journey, I have used LLMs quite a bit to help me with tricky sentences and grammer structures.
I realized that AI, when used effectifly, is a powerful tool for language learning.
I decieded to share my love of learning Japanese with the power of AI and created Gengo.

This is very much a work in progress!
